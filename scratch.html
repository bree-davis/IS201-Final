<p> I thought I would use my scratch page as a place to share more about myself! Here are some of my favorite things:</p>

</p>

<h2>Backpacking</h2>
<p>
I grew up in Idaho and being outside has always been a huge part of my life.
Every summer that I can remember included at least one backpacking trip, usually
to a lake within the Sawtooth Mountain Range. Being in the mountains helps me feel 
grounded and reminds me to slow down and appreciate God’s creations.

<h2>Rafting</h2>
<p>
I also love to raft. I’ve been rafting since I was a kid, and it’s always a fun way to spend time with my cousins and cool off during the summer. We have been on a few multi-day trips, but for the most part we raft the main fork of the Payette River.

<h2>Skiing</h2>
<p>
During the winter, I love to ski. My mom's side of the faimly is super into skiing, and beyond frequent ski trips to our local mountains, we go on at least one big ski trip a year. Those trips are the highlight of my winter.

<h2>Trips</h2>
<p>
Some of my favorite memories come from traveling and experiencing new places.
I especially love simple trips where I can spend a lot of time with my loved ones,
but I also enjoy getting to explore other places farther away from home.

<h2>Family and Friends</h2>
<p>
Most of all, I love spending time with my family and my bestfriends. We have a lot of fun traditions, and I cherish every moment we spend together. I truly would do anything for them and all of my best memories are with them. They are more important to me than almost anything else in my life.
